AlphaBooks is a web application designed to help make the worldâ€™s information generally accessible by delivering books from libraries to people. It aims to increase the number of people reading books, keeping in mind sustainability standards. 

The system will allow users to search for books, get recommendations and place orders. 
On the side of delivery, the program generates optimal and safer routes for couriers to satisfy their requests while being less exposed to the risks of COVID-19.
